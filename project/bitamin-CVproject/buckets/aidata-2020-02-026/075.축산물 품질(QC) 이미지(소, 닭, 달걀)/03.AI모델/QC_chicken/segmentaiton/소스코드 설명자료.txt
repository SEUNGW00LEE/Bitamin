## 기본적으로 Jupyter를 이용하여 수행
## 코드가 담긴 cell에 마우스 클릭하여 cell을 활성화
## 활성화된 cell에 "shift + Enter" 혹은 "ctrl + Enter"를 눌러 수행


### Preprocess
```
Preprocessing.ipynb - Data preprocessing
It preprocesses the input data (i.e., images) after setting the data path.
```


### Train
```
Train_Model.ipynb - Model training for segmentation of chicken area
It trains the segmentation model for classifying each pixel from the input image 
(i.e., finding area of the chicken) using the preprocessed data.
```


### Prediction (Evaluation)
```
Prediction.ipynb - Prediction of segmented chicken area and evaluation of the trained model performance
It predicts chicken area from an input image which contains a chicken.
It can measure the performance of the trained model.
```
