### Preprocess
```
Preprocess.ipynb - Data preprocessing
It preprocesses the input data (i.e., images) after setting the data path.
```


### Train
```
Train_Model.ipynb - Model training for classification of egg grades
It trains the classification model for classifying the egg grades 
using the preprocessed data.
```


### Prediction (Evaluation)
```
Prediction.ipynb - Prediction of egg grade and evaluation of the trained model performance
It predicts egg grade from some input images which consist of top-view egg image or side-view egg image.
It can measure the performance of the trained model.
```
