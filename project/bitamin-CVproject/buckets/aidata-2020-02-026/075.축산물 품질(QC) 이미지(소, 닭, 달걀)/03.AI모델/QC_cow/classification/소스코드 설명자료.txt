### Preprocess
```
Preprocess.ipynb - Data preprocessing
It preprocesses the input data (i.e., images) after setting the data path.
```


### Train
```
Train_Model.ipynb - Model training for classification of cow beef grades
It trains the classification model for classifying the cow beef grades 
using the preprocessed data.
```


### Prediction (Evaluation)
```
Prediction.ipynb - Prediction of cow beef grade and evaluation of the trained model performance
It predicts cow beef grade from an input image which contains only one cow beef.
It can measure the performance of the trained model.
```
